For decades, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have dominated the landscape of artificial intelligence, mimicking — albeit loosely — the connections between neurons in the brain. But what if there is a different paradigm, one that forgoes the intricate architecture of layered nodes and instead encodes knowledge into  abstract symbols? This is the promise of hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a framework in which information is represented as vectors with thousands of dimensions -hypervectors- where information is distributed across dimensions.

Hypervectors are remarkably robust: they maintain their semantic integrity even when many of their components are altered. This resilience arises because meaning is distributed across dimensions, not localized in any single part. This makes HDC inherently fault-tolerant and ideal for low-power, noise-resilient computing — systems where memory and computation can merge without sacrificing stability.

Crucially, this approach reflects how our brains store information: not in single neurons, but in overlapping patterns across many. Similarly, a hypervector spreads meaning across all dimensions, allowing concepts to be combined and manipulated through simple algebra. This means we can define an algebra of operations over hypervectors — a mathematical framework that enables the composition, transformation, and extraction of structured information using well-defined operators.

HDC is a new framework for artificial intelligence that not only covers classical machine learning tasks but also naturally extends into the domain of symbolic AI.
