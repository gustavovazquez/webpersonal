# Introduction to Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), is a computational paradigm inspired by how the brain represents and manipulates information. Instead of working with scalar values or low-dimensional vectors, HDC operates on high-dimensional vectors—called **hypervectors**—that typically have thousands of components. These hypervectors are used to encode data, perform operations, and learn patterns in a manner that is robust, scalable, and parallelizable.

## HDC vs. Traditional Machine Learning

While traditional machine learning models rely heavily on optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent), loss functions, and large amounts of labeled data, HDC takes a different approach:

| Aspect                     | Traditional ML                      | Hyperdimensional Computing            |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Representation**        | Numeric features, embeddings         | Fixed-length high-dimensional vectors (hypervectors) |
| **Computation**           | Optimization-based (e.g., backprop) | Algebraic manipulation of hypervectors |
| **Learning**              | Model fitting                        | Prototype hypervector accumulation     |
| **Robustness**            | Sensitive to noise, overfitting      | Robust to noise and partial corruption |
| **Interpretability**      | Often opaque                         | Transparent representations (symbolic-like) |
| **Hardware Compatibility**| General-purpose CPUs/GPUs            | Neuromorphic and in-memory computing   |

HDC is particularly suitable for edge computing, few-shot learning, and scenarios where energy efficiency and fast adaptation are crucial.

## Neural-Inspired Properties of Hypervectors

Hypervectors share several properties with neural representations observed in the brain:

- **High Dimensionality**: Like neural population codes, hypervectors use many dimensions to encode information redundantly.
- **Distributed Representation**: Each piece of information is spread across all dimensions of the vector, mimicking the distributed nature of synaptic activity.
- **Noise Tolerance**: The system can recover the original signal even when parts of a hypervector are corrupted, akin to fault-tolerance in neural systems.
- **Similarity Preservation**: Similar inputs produce similar hypervectors, facilitating analogical reasoning and generalization.

These properties make hypervectors suitable for representing complex, symbolic, and structured data in a biologically plausible way.

## Key Operations in HDC

The power of HDC lies in a small set of well-defined operations that manipulate hypervectors to encode and decode information:

- **Binding (`⊗`)**: Combines two hypervectors (e.g., key and value) into a new one that is dissimilar to both. Commonly implemented as element-wise XOR (binary) or element-wise multiplication (real/complex).
- **Bundling (`⊕`)**: Aggregates multiple hypervectors into a single representative one, preserving similarity. Often implemented as element-wise majority or averaging.
- **Permutation (`ρ`)**: Rearranges the elements of a hypervector to encode sequential or positional information (e.g., shifting, rotating).

These operations are **invertible** (to some extent), enabling symbolic reasoning over distributed representations.

## Advantages of Hyperdimensional Computing

HDC offers a range of advantages over conventional approaches:

- **Efficiency**: Learning can often be done in a single pass (one-shot or few-shot).
- **Scalability**: Easily parallelizable; hypervector dimensions can be adapted to the problem.
- **Robustness**: Resistant to noise, missing data, and adversarial corruption.
- **Interpretable Representations**: The structure of hypervectors can be traced to symbolic components.
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Amenable to low-power, brain-inspired computing hardware.

These features make HDC a promising framework for applications in embedded AI, robotics, cognitive modeling, and neuroscience.
