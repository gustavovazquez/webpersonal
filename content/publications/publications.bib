	abstract = {Missing data is a common issue in different fields, such as electronics, image processing, medical records and genomics. They can limit or even bias the posterior analysis. The data collection process can lead to different distribution, frequency, and structure of missing data points. They can be classified into four categories: Structurally Missing Data (SMD), Missing Completely At Random (MCAR), Missing At Random (MAR) and Missing Not At Random (MNAR). For the three later, and in the context of genomic data (especially non-coding data), we will discuss six imputation approaches using 31,245 variants collected from ClinVar and annotated with 13 genome-wide features.},

However, the large number of p-tools available and the heterogeneity of their output make their selection and comparison difficult. To study the consistency of predictions across p-tools, here we present two indices and test them on five p-tools whose predictions are based on different types of background information. For this test, SNPs from well-known organism Drosophila melanogaster are considered.},

	abstract = {Several feature extraction approaches for QSPR modelling in Cheminformatics are discussed in this paper. In particular, this work is focused on the use of these strategies for predicting mechanical properties, which are relevant for the design of polymeric materials. The methodology analysed in this study employs a feature learning method that uses a quantification process of 2D structural characterization of materials with the autoencoder method. Alternative QSPR models inferred for tensile strength at break (a well-known mechanical property of polymers) are presented. These alternative models are contrasted to QSPR models obtained by feature selection technique by using accuracy measures and a visual analytic tool. The results show evidence about the benefits of combining feature learning approaches with feature selection methods for the design of QSPR models.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders in elder population. The β-site amyloid cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the major constituent of amyloid plaques and plays a central role in this brain pathogenesis, thus it constitutes an auspicious pharmacological target for its treatment. In this paper, a QSAR model for identification of potential inhibitors of BACE1 protein is designed by using classification methods. For building this model, a database with 215 molecules collected from different sources has been assembled. This dataset contains diverse compounds with different scaffolds and physical-chemical properties, covering a wide chemical space in the drug-like range. The most distinctive aspect of the applied QSAR strategy is the combination of hybridization with backward elimination of models, which contributes to improve the quality of the final QSAR model. Another relevant step is the visual analysis of the molecular descriptors that allows guaranteeing the absence of information redundancy in the model. The QSAR model performances have been assessed by traditional metrics, and the final proposed model has low cardinality, and reaches a high percentage of chemical compounds correctly classified.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present results on prediction of elongation at break (target property) for a group of 77 amorphous polymers of high molecular weight. Novel descriptors are proposed in order to better represent structural features related to the target property. These proposed descriptors along with the classic ones, were calculated for the set of polymers. The final descriptors of the predictive model were obtained by using a combination of variable selection method and domain knowledge. The model consisted of three descriptors: Cross-head Speed (CHS), Number Average Molecular Weight/Main Chain Surface Area ratio (Mn/SAMC), and Normalized Main Chain Mass (nMMC). By means of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network a good prediction model (R2=0.88 and MAE=1.89) was achieved, which was internally and externally validated. The model shows the advantages of using well-known parameters in the field of polymers and of capturing the structural characteristics of the main and side chains. Thus, more intelligent tools are developed for the design of new materials with a specific application profile.},

	abstract = {New descriptors of main and side chains for polymers with high molecular weight are presented in order to predict the glass-transition temperature (Tg) by means of Tg/M ratio. They were obtained by molecular modeling for the middle unit in a series of three repeating units (trimer). Taken together with other classic descriptors calculated for the entire trimeric structure, the ones that correlated better with the property were selected by using a variable selection method. Only three descriptors were chosen: main chain surface area (SAMC), side chain mass (MSC) and number of rotatable bonds (RBN), where the first two descriptors belong to the set of the new ones proposed. By means of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network a good prediction model (R2=0.953 and RMS=0.25Kmol/g) was achieved and internally (R2=0.964 and RMS=0.41Kmol/g) and externally (R2=0.933 and RMS =0.47Kmol/g) validated. The dataset included 88 polymers. The selected descriptors and the quality of the obtained model demonstrate the advantages of capturing through computational molecular modeling the structural characteristics of the polymers’ main and side chains in the prediction of Tg/M.},
